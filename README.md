# Student Roster

## A simple JavaScript project using data pagination and filtering

**Student Roster** application pulls data from an array of student information (including *name*, *email*, *date joined*, and *profile picture*) and creates a web page using the information from the `data.js` file. 

Users can click through each page to see students, or search and filter student names using the `search box`.
